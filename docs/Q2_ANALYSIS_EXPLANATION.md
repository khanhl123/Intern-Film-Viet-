# Question 2 — Early Adopters vs Slow-burn: When Does the Audience Show Up?

## What we’re looking for
We want to find out: which states, cities, and cinemas are “fast starters” and which are “slow burners”? This helps decide where to launch first and where to wait.

---

## How I approached it
1. **Relative week**: For every film and location, I tracked which week was “week 1” (the first week it played there), so I could compare movies that started at different times.
2. **Early vs late revenue**: I split each location’s box office into “early” (weeks 1–2) and “late” (week 3+), and calculated the share of revenue that came early.
3. **Weighted averages**: Bigger films count more, so I weighted the averages by total gross.
4. **Timing types**: Locations are grouped into Early Adopters, Balanced, or Slow-burn, based on how much revenue comes in the first two weeks.
5. **Validation**: I checked how quickly each place reaches 95% of its total revenue.

## What the outputs show

- **Timing maps**: Bubble charts show which cities and cinemas are fast or slow, and how big their markets are.
- **Speed bar charts**: See how many cinemas and cities reach 95% of their revenue in 1, 2, 3, or more weeks, broken down by timing type.

## How FilmViet can use this
- **Release sequencing**: Launch in early adopter locations first for quick returns, then roll out to slow-burn markets.
- **Screen planning**: Hold screens for a shorter time in fast markets, and longer in slow ones.
- **Marketing**: Go big at launch in early adopter cities; spread out the spend in slow-burn places.
- **Portfolio**: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket—balance quick wins with long-tail markets.
     - Bottom 25% → **SLOW_BURN**

5. **Validate timing using "weeks_to_95"**
   - Build cumulative revenue share across rel_week per place.
   - Compute:
     - `weeks_to_95` = first rel_week where cumulative share ≥ 95%
   - Early adopters should hit 95% faster; slow-burn should take longer.

## What each output represents 

### Output 1 — Timing Map (Cities): Early Share vs Total Gross
- **Each dot = a city**
- **X-axis:** `weighted_early_share` (Week 1–2 share of total)
  - Right = people watch quickly (early adopter)
  - Left  = demand builds later (slow-burn)
- **Y-axis:** `total_gross` (log scale)
  - Higher = bigger market overall
- **Color groups:** EARLY_ADOPTER / BALANCED / SLOW_BURN (based on Q25/Q75)
- **Key takeaway:**
  - **Top-right** = best "release first" cities (big + fast payoff)
  - **Top-left**  = big but slow-burn cities (worth releasing, but later/longer hold)

### Output 2 — Timing Map (Cinemas): Early Share vs Total Gross
- **Same logic as cities, but at cinema level**
- Shows which individual cinemas are early vs slow-burn adopters
- Helps FilmViet decide:
  - Which cinemas to include in Wave 1 rollout
  - Which to hold back for Wave 2 (extended run)
- **Top 10 cinemas labeled** to avoid clutter

### Output 3 — Cinema Speed Distribution: weeks_to_95 by Timing Class
- **Each bar = a timing class** (SLOW_BURN, BALANCED, EARLY_ADOPTER)
- **Stack segments** show how many cinemas reach 95% cumulative revenue by:
  - Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4, etc.
- **Key takeaway:**
  - **EARLY_ADOPTER** cinemas cluster at **weeks_to_95 = 1–2** (fast payoff)
  - **SLOW_BURN** cinemas shift to **weeks_to_95 = 3+** (need longer run)
  - Shows the business reality: early adopters recoup fast, slow-burn need patience

### Output 4 — City Speed Distribution: weeks_to_95 by Timing Class
- **Same as Output 3, but for cities**
- Aggregate cinema-level patterns into city markets
- Helps FilmViet understand:
  - City-level market velocity
  - Which cities are "quick turnovers" vs "long-tail markets"

### Output 5 — Revenue Distribution by Timing Type (Box Plot)
- **Each box = a timing class** (EARLY_ADOPTER, BALANCED, SLOW_BURN)
- **Y-axis:** `total_gross` (log scale) — revenue per cinema
- **Box elements explain:**
  - **Median (line in box):** The "typical" cinema revenue in that timing class
  - **Box height (IQR):** Where 50% of cinemas fall (consistency of revenue)
  - **Whiskers:** Full range of cinemas (best to worst performers)
  - **Dots above/below:** Outliers (unusually high or low revenue)

**Key insights:**
- **EARLY_ADOPTER (Blue):** Highest revenue potential, widest range (some mega cinemas, some underperformers)
  - Median: ~$300K–$500K
  - Outliers reach $5M+ (premium locations)
  - Action: Prioritize these locations for Wave 1
  
- **BALANCED (Orange):** Consistent, predictable revenue
  - Median: ~$200K–$400K
  - Stable box (reliable cinemas)
  - Action: Standard rollout, can scale easily
  
- **SLOW_BURN (Green):** Broad spread of cinemas (mix of small and medium)
  - Median: ~$200K–$300K
  - Wide range: some small ($2K), some large ($1.5M)
  - Action: Don't underestimate—includes valuable long-tail revenue

**Business takeaway:** Don't ignore slow-burn cinemas. While they may be slower to convert, collectively they hold 30%+ of market revenue. The box plot shows you have high-value slow-burn locations worth including in your portfolio strategy.

## How this helps FilmViet (business actions)

### Release Sequencing
- **Wave 1 (Days 1–2):** Release in EARLY_ADOPTER cities/cinemas
  - Fast cashflow, quick ROI confirmation
  - Minimize screen holds in these locations
- **Wave 2 (Week 2–3):** Add BALANCED and SLOW_BURN markets
  - Let Wave 1 build word-of-mouth
  - Extended screen holds in slow-burn locations

### Screen Planning
- **Early adopters:** Plan for peak in Week 1–2
  - Shorter screen hold (2–3 weeks typical)
  - Maximize screens in Week 1
- **Slow-burn:** Plan for extended run (4–5 weeks+)
  - Lower peak, but sustained demand
  - Hold screens longer, monitor weekly trends

### Marketing Budget
- **Early adopter cities:** Front-load marketing, launch intensity high
  - "Frontload" strategy: capture demand spike
- **Slow-burn cities:** Steady marketing throughout run
  - "Drip" strategy: build awareness over time

### Portfolio Strategy
- Avoid releasing **only** in early adopters (leaves money on the table)
- Avoid releasing **all at once** in slow-burn markets (cash flow risk)
- **Balanced rollout:** 40% early adopters (Week 1) + 60% balanced/slow-burn (Week 2+)
  - Staggered revenue, managed risk, optimized cash flow
